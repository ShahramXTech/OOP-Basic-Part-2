# OOP-Basic-Part-2


This repository contains a collection of C++ programs developed after completing Programming Fundamentals (PF) in the first semester of BS Software Engineering. The focus of these programs is to strengthen Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts through practical and beginner-friendly examples.

✨ Key Concepts Covered

Classes and Objects

Constructors (default, parameterized, copy)

Encapsulation (getters & setters)

Static data members

Real-world problem modeling

Basic input/output handling

🧪 Program Examples

Object creation and class methods

Shape area calculation using constructors

Employee record management

Car speed control (accelerate & brake)

Inventory and cost calculation system

Library book management system

Student data handling with constructors

🎯 Purpose

These programs are intended for practice, learning, and revision of core OOP concepts and serve as a solid foundation for advanced Software Engineering subjects.

🛠️ Tools & Language

Language: C++

Environment: Any standard C++ compiler (GCC / Visual Studio / Code::Blocks)
